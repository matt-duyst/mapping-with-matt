### Intro:

The purpose of this unit's assignment is to introduce the process of digitizing and editing vector features in both ArcGIS and QGIS.  For this assignment, you may use either ArcGIS or QGIS -- both software packages will allow you to complete the assignment.  Your task is to reconstruct several street blocks of 1950s Hollywood by digitizing building footprints and the footprints of any other notable features present on a 1950 Sanborn fire insurance map of a small section of Hollywood, and then create a print-quality map of this area showing building footprints visually categorized by building function/type.  Since you already have experience and practice with georeferencing images, a georeferenced GeoTIFF is provided for you.  The northwestern corner of the area represented in the GeoTIFF is the intersection of Hollywood Blvd and Cahuenga.
