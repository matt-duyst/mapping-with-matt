### Intro:

This work centers around a network analysis method of market-based locations vis-à-vis the use of GIS. In specific, the locations of Starbucks coffee shops in Riverside, County. Data for the store locations was achieved through OpenStreetMap. Network analysis tools were used to generate 3-minute drive time buffers between each coffee shop (map 1). This drive time buffer was then joined to block census data in Riverside County, allowing for an analysis of the summation of blocks that intersect within these stores with 3 main variables: Total population density (map 3), a targeted age demographic between the ages of 25-34 (map 4), and the blocks’ median household income (map 5). Map 2 illustrates the full use of Network Analysis Tools: to generate distance-based buffers (total drive time) between each Starbucks store, with a store recommended for closure as the origin (the Target Arlington Starbucks).

Improvements made would be altering the Drive-Time representation to more understandable numbers - less decimals.

### The Importance of Drive-Time: Starbucks Store Locations in Riverside County, CA

Map 1 illustrates a 3-minute drive time service area between each Starbucks coffee shop. However, one store was purposely covered by the legend in each map (Vons Starbucks), due to its outside placement on the border of Riverside near San Bernadino. In full, a little over 70% of Riverside’s population (472,087 people out of 593,012) fall within a 3-minute radius (drive time) of any given Starbucks coffee shop. Moreover, the highways in Riverside are depicted in red, a bright observation that allows for an interesting parallel to be made: Starbucks coffee shops are generally found off the highways, most likely as pit-stops for drivers.

Map 2 depicts a grand use of network analysis tools: To produce buffers that correspond to an estimation of distance traveled between each Starbucks location, generated by using the proposed store for closure as the origin. These buffers (represented as black lines) correspond to the total drive time between the stores. The store with the longest drive time is the store excluded from most maps (nearly a 14-minute drive time). The largest reason for closing the Target

### Understanding Your Targeted Audience: Starbucks' Demographic Analysis

Map 4 illustrates a nuanced range of age groups (years 25 to 34 in age), used as Starbucks’ primary consumers, along with the 3-minute drive time, each store location, and the background highways of Riverside. As one would expect, the larger the concentration of individuals between this age range mirrors the higher concentration of Starbucks coffee shops. In specific, census tracts with a range of 250 to 900 residents have the closest proximity to a Starbucks location—the chain’s attempt to build closer to their target audience.

Map 5 denotes the median household income for the residents of Riverside County, coupled with the same 3-minute drive time, the Starbucks coffee shops locations, and the outlined highways. The range is between a low of $36,042 and a high of $188,077. Although the map shows a somewhat scattered representation of the median income block data, it can be roughly stated that the Southern region of Riverside County lies within the range of $70,000 and higher, while the central and Northern region of Riverside is between $36,000 to $70,000. The service area for each given Starbucks (joined with the census block data for total population size), allows for an interesting analysis of store placement: the largest bulk of Starbucks’ buyers fall within an income of less than roughly $75,000. This map mirrors the age group generalization—that the blocks with larger quantities of individuals aged 25-39 are also the blocks with higher incomes, and therefor closer to a Starbucks coffee shop.

Map 3 is used a general representation of understanding the Starbucks store locations desire placement, corresponding to Riverside’s total population. I decided to use the total population as the broad basis for this analysis, because this map conjures a general and easily predicted understanding, while the latter maps focus on a more nuanced representation that will allow for a more mindful and targeted analysis. The range is between 1199 residents (the lightest shading) per block, and 7700 per block (the darkest shading). Roughly 8 out of 11 Starbucks locations fall within a block of 2300 residents or higher—a vast understanding to Starbucks trend of store placement. Blocks with residents of 2300-7700 hold the majority of Starbucks audience buyers. Starbucks conveniently placed store locations off the highways to make up for the remaining blocks with less people, ergo the blocks with less possible buyers.
