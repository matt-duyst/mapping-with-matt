This map was realized through the natural breaks classification method, coupled with the single hue change in the color red. Furthermore, this map deals with 4 classes of behavior in data instead of 5. I chose 4 classes because (when inputting 5) the range appeared to dwindle in nature— reducing in size. Predominately, the most data falls between the two middle classes (26-31%, and 31-35.6%). Because of this fact, I chose to use a graduated color scheme. The single color of altering hues of reds releases attention or focus on these middle values, and allows for the most attention to be focused on the lowest and highest states in regards to population.

This map was created using a graduated color scheme and a natural break classification method. This method of classification was employed because the dataset illustrated in the histogram was essentially unimodal — a majority of data falling in-between the middle range. I chose to use primary colors that are not too distracting for the viewer, and yet simultaneously catch the viewer’s gaze to the contrasting colors of lowest and highest alterations in unemployment rates. Ergo, the modest and none obtrusive colors accentuated for the middle range class is a dual-attempt to further the attention towards the two extremes.

Mapping the percentage of rural areas in the US was a culmination of graduated colors and natural break classification methods, due the to nature of the data’s distribution when put on a histogram. The use of 5 classes is of importance when viewing the map; it allows two classes to be witnessed on both ends of the middle, most common, population percentage. The varying hues of the single shade of brown parallels the rural population/behavior being spatially analyzed. This color also does a grand job at showing the contrast in lowest rural percentage (the lightest shade of brown), and the highest rural percentage (the darkest shade of brown).

This map was achieved differently than the previous two; it was created using a text field, unlike the previous numerical classification categories. These single values were then classified into six differing classes — Middle Atlantic, Midwest, New England, South, Southwest, and West. The color schemes purposely clash with each other, in an attempt to illustrate the contrasting regions of each conglomerated region of states on the map. The masked, white outline further allows for outlining of state abbreviations, and likewise doesn’t distract the viewer but rather accentuates an easy interpretation of the United States by state regions.

This map was manifested using the standard deviation method, with five classes at the base of its origin. I chose a color scheme that I believe allows an easily understandable reading of total state population; the contrasting shade of the two colors (brown and blue) allows for the uttermost attention to be drawn towards the states with the highest (darkest blue) and lowest (darkest brown) populations. When analyzing the histogram for the data, an obvious left-skew was realized. Ergo, it was more common for states to have a lower population, especially with the two highest outliers of California and Texas.
