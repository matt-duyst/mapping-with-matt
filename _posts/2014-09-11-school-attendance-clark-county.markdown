### The Correlation between Elementary School Attendance & Registered Voters: Clark County, NV

In this assignment you will use QGIS to perform geoprocessing and spatial overlay analysis.   There are many practical applications of these types of analysis: you can use overlay analysis to aid in determining how many customers can be served by a store, looking at the potential impacts of airport noise on residential areas, or seeing how a road might impact animal migration routes, among many other such uses.  For this assignment, though, you will be assuming the role of a GIS Analyst for a large school district -- the work that you will complete within the scope of this assignment closely resembles actual spatial analysis tasks and responsibilities often given to professional GIS analysts.

Imagine that you are employed by the Clark County (Nevada) School District (one of the country's largest school districts) as a GIS analyst, and that the district's elected Board of Trustees, each of whom represent a defined geographic zone, has decided (1) to study changing their elementary school attendance areas to minimize class sizes, and (2) to better ensure student safety, provide bus transportation for all students who live more than one mile from the nearest school.  (Note that this is a hypothetical scenario based on real-world data designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to spatial analysis.)

Based on databases provided by the Clark County School District and the Clark County Election Department, your responsibility is to prepare a professionally-presented report that, using maps, tables, and text identifies how many (total and percentage) registered voters per school live within each elementary school attendance area in District C, and how many (total and percentage) registered voters will be able to send their children to school using bus transportation provided by the district..  Attached to the report should be a spreadsheet that presents a tabular list of registered voters in District C whose households will be eligible for school bus transportation, such that these people can be notified by mail.  This spreadsheet need only contain the voter's names and full mailing addresses (available in attribute table).

Your report must contain the following maps:
A map showing (1) the elementary school attendance areas within District C, (2) the locations of elementary schools in that area, and (3) the locations of registered voters (symbolized using small points such that all are visible);
A choropleth map where the value represented with the choropleth layer is the number of registered voters in each elementary school attendance area within District C.  The attendance zones that contain both the highest and lowest numbers of registered voters per school (hint: use field calculation) should be highlighted visually, and the names of the schools associated with the attendance areas should be included on the map. 
All maps must also include all required common map elements, including a title, your name, a description of the data source, a neat line, and a legend.  Base maps should be included to provide context when appropriate.
