This project underscores the necessity of using high spatial resolution sensors when mapping urban centers, by contrasting a fine-resolution Landsat8 image with a medium-resoltion MODIS image in Los Angeles. This exploration of using different spatial resolutions is coupled with the introduction of Supervised Classification, as we examine varying land cover types embedded in an urban setting.

Supervised Classification allows more autonomy than its counterpart, Unsupervised Classification. A Supervised Classification gives the creator the ability to designate specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the image that correspond to different land cover types. The user can then specify the amount of pixel values or spectral indices for each class.
