### Potential Inundation: Sea Level Rise in Miami-Data County, Florida

![Map GIS](/assets/images/Inundation.png)

For this assignment, you will use QGIS to (1) perform sea level change analysis using a high-resolution digital elevation model and (2) create a map that clearly and intuitively presents areas of potential inundation for at least three sea level change scenarios of varying severity.  You are free to select any study area aside from the area covered in the demonstration videos (the area surrounding Savannah, Georgia in the United States).  Through completing this mapping exercise, you will learn the following GIS mapping and analysis techniques:
Retrieval of high-resolution coastal topobathymetric digital elevation models (DEMs) from official sources;
Interpretation and basic processing of raster elevation datasets;
Conversion vertical units of elevation in DEMs using raster calculation;
Application of boolean expressions using raster calculation to (1) highlight areas currently above and below sea level and (2) model potential areas of inundation resulting from changes in sea level;
Use of map algebra to compare areas currently above/below sea level with results of modeling sea level change;
Visualization strategies that highlight areas of potential inundation as a result of future sea level increases resulting from climate change.
Outcomes
The map that you create with QGIS Layouts should contain the following contents:
Layers indicating potential inundation areas for moderate, severe, and extreme sea level rise, visually superimposed such that the most vulnerable areas appear darkest (hint: use "Multiply" blending mode for layer rendering);
One of the following:
A basemap that provides political boundaries (states, counties, countries, etc.) and useful reference information, including populated places (we recommend using the appropriate ESRI base layer from the QuickMapServices plugin), OR;
Custom vector layer(s), appropriately labeled, providing political boundaries and useful reference information;
A satellite/aerial imagery basemap covering the full extent of the map (again, we recommend using the ESRI Satellite layer from the QuickMapServices plugin);
Common map elements, including a neat line (frame around map contents), a title, a legend containing intelligible labels for all layers that should be included; scale bar with user-friendly interval and caption containing representative fraction (RF) scale and data sources.
