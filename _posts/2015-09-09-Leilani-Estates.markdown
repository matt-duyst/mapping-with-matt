### Intro:

Hawaii's mainland appears to be a newly reoccurring hotspot for recent lava flow activity. The maps below illustrate the buildings at harm in Keilani Estates, as well as the currently active lava flow fissures. The issue of surmounting lava flows in Hawaii has forced roughly 2,000 people in Hawaii to evacuate or relocate, and turned a place of palm trees and paradise into fear and hot rock. These lava flows have also taken out entire communities and buildings such as those around Keilani Estates. In total, nearly 40 structures have been taken out by the lava.

a static map to accentuate the 3D rendered mappings. generate maps of natural disaster scenarios using a plugin for QGIS (called qgis2web) that is capable of generating interactive three-dimensional maps based on QGIS map projects
