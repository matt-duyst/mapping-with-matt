Likelihood of enhancements in cell coverage were thought through 3 possibilities: adding cell towers, expanding the current range of coverage, or increasing the height of current cell towers. The success of this project fringed upon Viewshed Analysis, which allowed for these hypothetic adjustments to T-Mobile‚Äôs cell towers to come to fruition.</p><p>Improvements could be made by showcasing the increased range in cell coverage in a different color than the current range. Centering the area of study (LA County) to the map extent and minimizing map features (North Arrow, Scale, and Legend), would produce a more visually appealing map from a cartographic point-of-view. Illustrating the addition of towers in the second map could also be more apparent with a different representation that‚Äôs easier to notice.</p><h3 id="methods">Methods:</h3><p>The outline of LA County was provided from USGS EarthExplorer as an array of GeoTIFF‚Äôs (digital elevation models). These were then converted into rasters, through the ‚ÄúMosaic to New Raster‚Äù option in ArcToolbox. The specific locations for each cell tower were obtained through a CSV, downloaded on T-Mobile‚Äôs website. This CSV was then converted into a shapefile, with its attribute table being edited to meet each required element ‚Äî T-Mobile‚Äôs current coverage (map 1), coverage with the addition of 3 towers (map 2), coverage with an increased range of 5,000Km (map 3), and coverage with increased tower heights of 10m (map 4).</p><h3 id="results">Results:</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/t-mobile-cell-coverage.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This map illustrates the current placement of T-Mobile towers in LA County. In total, there are 104 cell towers - the majority of which are concentrated in central and southern Los Angeles. The towers‚Äô height, coverage radius, and several factors about the earth‚Äôs trajectory were set at given increments. The total amount of area not covered in Los Angeles County is 58.9%, an average calculated by dividing the maximum (7,247,374,591) by the sum (12,301,062,346). To find the average area covered by current T-Mobile towers, this number was subtracted by 100. 41.1% of LA County is covered by T-Mobile.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/3-added-towers.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>The above map offers an insight to what 3 additional cell towers would achieve for improving T-Mobile‚Äôs cell service in LA County. The placement of added towers was chosen in areas lacking in coverage: Malibu, Palmdale, and Lancaster. The same parameters for calculating coverage of this scenario were held constant with the prior map. The addition of 3 towers had the most significant result on increasing T-Mobile total coverage (a total of 45.8%).</p><p><img src="/assets/images/25k-to-30k.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>This map represents the impact of an increased radius of 5,000km ‚Äî from 25,000km to 30,000km. While one would assume increasing the radius by a number as staggering as 5,000km would alter coverage significantly, a mere of 0.6% difference was achieved. The same methodology for total coverage area was applied: dividing the maximum (this time 7,172,600,041) by the sum (12,301,062,346) and subtracting by 100. 58.3% was the result, and when subtracted by 100 left for a total coverage of 41.7% in LA County.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/increased-towers-10m.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>This final map considers the difference an alteration of 10 meters in cell tower height might have on T-Mobile coverage in LA County. Interestingly, altering the tower height (as opposed to increasing the range) had a much more significant impact on cell coverage area. By increasing the towers‚Äô height by 10 meters, the coverage area increased by almost 2% (a total of 43.6%). The same viewshed analysis factors were held constant: dividing the max (this time 6,935,051,785) by the sum (12,301,062,346), to get the total area not covered (56.4%). This number was then subtracted by 100 to get the total area covered.</p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">More Projects</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/31/mass-shootings/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/total-mass-shootings.png" alt="US Mass Shootings: Forces of Prediction, or Varying Inconsistencies?"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">US Mass Shootings: Forces of Prediction, or Varying Inconsistencies?</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/30/San-Diego/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/camping-locations.png" alt="Site Suitability Analysis: San Diego Elevation Mappings for a Summer Campground"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Site Suitability Analysis: San Diego Elevation Mappings for a Summer Campground</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/29/T-mobile-cell/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/t-mobile-cell-coverage.png" alt="Modifications of T-Mobile Cell Towers for Accentuated Coverage Areas: Los Angeles, CA"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Modifications of T-Mobile Cell Towers for Accentuated Coverage Areas: Los Angeles, CA</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><div class="footer__container"> ¬© Mapping With Matt</div></div></footer><section class="contact popup"><div class="popup__close"><div class="popup__exit"></div></div><div class="contact__container popup__container"><div class="contact__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url();"></figure></div><div class="contact__content"><div class="contact__mast section-padding--half"><div class="grid"><h2>Contact</h2></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><hr class="sep"/></div><div class="contact__form section-padding--half"><div class="grid-xlarge"> <form id="form" class="form" action="https://formcarry.com/s/HkIo0nMb7" method="POST"><div class="form__subcontainer"><div> <label for="form-first-name">First Name</label> <input type="text" name="first-name" id="form-first-name" required></div><div> <label for="form-last-name">Last Name</label> <input type="text" name="last-name" id="form-last-name" required></div></div><div> <label for="form-email">E-Mail</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="form-email" required></div><div> <label for="form-message">Message</label> <textarea name="message" id="form-message" rows="3"></textarea></div><div class="form__submit"><div class="form__btn"> <input type="submit" value="Send"></div></div><p class="form__message"></p></form></div></div></div></div></section><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
