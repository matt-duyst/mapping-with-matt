        <title>Modeling the Oasis of the Dry Great Basin: Predicting Water Values of Mono Lake</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-basic-understanding-of-mono-lake&quot;&gt;A Basic Understanding of Mono Lake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles began diverting water from Mono Lake in 1941. The goal of this predictive model is to examine the effect of different export policies on the elevation of Mono Lake. The differing models will project future sizes of the lake given different assumptions about the amount of water exported to Los Angeles. Through this analysis, the viewer will be able to ascertain how the lake level responds to changes in export policies - as well as derive a sustainable level of export. This viable tradeoff between lake level oscillations and tradeoff policies will be realized when the Mono Lake model indicates a stable equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure below depicts historical elevations of Mono Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mono-lake-elevation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-mono-lake---a-simplistic-model&quot;&gt;Modeling Mono Lake - A Simplistic Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mono-lake-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model illustrates a basic understanding - a simple interpretation of the varying inputs and outputs that dictate the amount of water in Mono Lake. However, as the viewer will see with the resulting graph below, this model is far too simplistic to produce tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameter values for the model are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/parameter-values.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of water in Mono Lake is measured in thousands of acre-feet (KAF). The model is run by years, so the units for the flows in the model will be KAF/year. Precipiation and Evaportaion parameters will be measured by feet/year. Precipitation is calculated by multiplying the surface area by the precipitation rate. Evaporation is calculated in the same manner - surface area * evaporation rate. The surface area is set to 39,000 acres (39K acres), the same as it appeared in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of water in Mono Lake is achieved by subtracting ‘Export’ from the Lake’s main flow of water - the runoff from the Sierra Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stock of the model is the amount of water in the Mono Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inputs inlcude: Runoff from Sierra Nevada, Precipitation onto the lake, and an ‘Other Out’ variable that includes ungauged runoff and municipal flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Outputs inlcude: Evaporation from the lake’s surface, an ‘Export’ variable that denotes the Los Angeles Aqueduct, and an ‘Other Out’ variable for remaining possible influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/graph-linear.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulation results from this model indicates water’s decline from Mono Lake in a linear fashion. In fact, with these parameters, water is projected to reach zero by 2030 - and continually decline below this “zero line” to -600 by the 2042.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that the water in Mono Lake would likely never be in the negative, we can conclude this model is too simplistic. A strictly linear decline does not make for a reliable simulation; the stock-and-flow diagram will need to be expanded to alter its structure and deliver reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-mono-lake---a-more-realistic-model&quot;&gt;Modeling Mono Lake - A More Realistic Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Mono Lake’s surface area should shrink as the volume of water in the lake declines. This model takes a more realistic approach by altering Surface Area into an internal variable - one that will parallel a decline in water volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/survey.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geological and bathymetric surveys were conducted to calculate the areas associated with varying volumes of water in Mono Lake. Elevation of the lake with the differing volume levels is also included in the survey. From a geographic standpoint, knowing the elevation of the lake is helpful because it indicates a plethora of conditions - like increasing exports impact on the lake. Looking at the extremes, no water in the lake would indicate 6,224 feet above sea level.. and 8,000 KAF in the lake would be 6,477 feet above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/model-2-and-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new model of Mono Lake includes the survey results listed prior. As stated above, ‘Surface Area’ needs to be an internal variable for our model. This variable, along with the newly added ‘Elevation’ variable from the survey will take the form of Converters and be directly tied with the amount of water in Mono Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-mono-lake---the-final-model&quot;&gt;Modeling Mono Lake - The Final Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After careful observation, it’s decided the missing factor for predicting the most accurate model is an accurate change in the rate of evaporation. Mono Lake is a saline lake, meaning the rate of evaporation is slower than fresh lakes. The slower rates of evaporation associated with saline lakes is caused by a reduction in vapor pressure difference between the surface of water and the overylying air. An accurate evaporation rate must take into consideration the large quantities of fixed solids dissolving in the lake’s shrinking volume of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/specific-gravity.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaporation studies, also called ‘Pan Studies’ as pans of water with differing salinities are exposed to evaporation, allow us to present a more realistic understanding of Mono Lake’s evaporation rate in association with gravity. The density of water in the lake is represented by ‘Specific Gravity’ - a measurement that compares the density of saline water to fresh water. For instance, a value of 1.1 indicates Mono Lake’s water is 10% heavier than fresh water. The impact of having a higher salinity for evaporation rates is represented by ‘Effect on Evaporation Rate.’ If the water in Mono Lake is 10% heavier compared to fresh water, for instance, the corresponding evaporation rate would be 92.6% of the rate for fresh water. Through this chart, we see as ‘Specific Gravity’ increases, the ‘Effect on Evaporation Rate’ decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Specific Gravity” is calculated through the following formula:
	(Water in Lake * Density of Fresh Water + Total Dissolved Solids) / Water in Lake * Density of Fresh Water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulation begins with 2,228 KAF of water in the lake. The density of fresh water is 1.359 million tons per KAF, and the total dissolved solids is 230 million tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific Gravity = 2,228 KAF * 1.359 Million Tons per KAF + 230 Million Tons / 2,228 KAF * 1.359 Million Tons per KAF
				 = 1.076&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpolating from the chart above, we can estimate a Specific Gravity of 1.076 is an evaporation rate of about 94% of the evaporation rate for fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/model-2-and-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new model of Mono Lake indicates that the added ‘Specific Gravity’ variable has a direct correlation on the evaporation rate. The “Specific Gravity Effect on Evap Rate” Converter in the model above represents this relationship. Internal variables like ‘Total Dissolved Solids’ and ‘Density of Fresh Water’ have also been added and linked to the ‘Specific Gravity’ variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/model-3-graph1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/model-3-graph2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time graphs above represent 4 variables: Water in Lake, Elevation, Specific Gravity, and Surface Area. The specific gravity simulation (graph 2) begins at 1.076, mirroring our calculation above. The simulation concludes at 1.163. The pattern for elevation (graph 1) parallels the movement of our second simulation for Mono Lake - a gradual decline that eventually reaches dynamic equilibrium. At the end of the simulation, the elevation is 6,336 feet above sea level. That’s a 16 foot difference in sea level than in our previous model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-mono-lake---a-simulated-buffer-policy-enacted&quot;&gt;Modeling Mono Lake - A Simulated Buffer Policy Enacted&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Model below simulates an export similar to a real proposal by the Mono Lake Commitee. The goal of this simulation is to come up with a realistic range for lake elevation that guarantees the ecosytem’s safety. The difference in models is the pre-existing ‘Export’ variable has been changed to a Converter and linked with the ‘Elevation’ Converter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/model-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/model-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the elevation is below 6,380 feet, exports are not allowed. If the elevation is above 6,390 feet, 100 KAF/yr is allowed. If the elevation is within our realistic range - a buffer zone, of sorts - export will change in a linear manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-mono-lake---a-simulated-control-board-policy&quot;&gt;Modeling Mono Lake - A Simulated Control Board Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/policy-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph above illustrates the impact of the California Water Resources Control Board’s export policy in 1994. The intention of this policy was to allow Mono Lake to reach an elevation near 6,392 feet. This would happen over many years and throughout various stages - hence the jagged shape of the graph. The policy described is as follows:
	- No export allowed until Mono Lake had an elevation of 6,377 feet
	- Once at 6,377 feet, exports allowed at 4.5 KAF/yr until elevation reaches 6,390 feet
	- Exports allowed at 16 KAF/yr until elevation reaches 6,391 feet
	- Exports allowed at 30.8 KAF/yr if elevation exceeds 6,391 feet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulation of this Export Policy is the graph above. Through its progression over a sufficiently long period of time, 100 years, we can deduce the future success of Control Board Policy. If the parameters set for exports of a given elevation level are maintained, the lake will reach dynamic equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>S-Shaped Growth: Modeling the Natural System of a Flowered Area</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;flower-model---intrinsic-growth-vs-actual-growth-rate&quot;&gt;Flower Model - Intrinsic Growth vs. Actual Growth Rate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model explores one of the six types of dynamic patterns: S-Shaped Growth graphings. S-Shaped graphs are crucial for describing patterns in natural systems. This project simulates the spread of flowers across a 1,000-acre landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flower-model1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two stocks in the model above: “Flowered Area” and “Empty Area.” The initial value for the “Flowered Area” is 10 acres; the “Empty Area” is 990 acres. With 10 acres purely of flowers, there will be minimal limitations hindering their spread - the seeds will have open space to grow in all directions. The variable “Decay Rate” is set to 20% per year, and is the product of the “Flowered Area” and rate of decay. The growth of the “Flowered Area” is dictated by the “Growth Rate” variable (a product of the Growth Rate and Flowered Area).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the model above only took the stated variables for simulation, the flowered area would expand by 80% per year. With no resource limitations, the model would assume an Intrinsic Growth Rate. To develop a more realistic model of the natural spread of flowers, an “Actual Growth Rate” variable will be introduced to the simulation. The “Actual Growth Rate” will be less than the Intrinsic Growth Rate of our first scenario - as the flowers spread across the landscape, the amount of “Empty Area” available will decrease and the flowers’ possibility to germinate will be increasingly harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flower-model1-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph above illustrates a remarkably quick spread of the “Flowered Area” within the first 10 years, but a dynamic equilibrium at 800 acres - not the full 1,000 acres available in the landscape. The “Flowered Area” starts with 10 acres, and within 6 years is covering 50 times its original breadth at a whopping 500 acres. This 6th year on the graph indicates the highest rate of growth in the “Flowered Area” as the growth exceeds the decay by the biggest margin. After this, the increasing trends starts to stabilize and eventually tapers off - an inverse of the first 6 years with a new decline in growth and increase in decay. Dynamic Equilibrium is met around the 12th year, 4/5th of the landscape completely covered in flowers. The flowers will never cover the entire landscape, because the “Decay Rate” is fixed at 20% throughout the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-a-disturbance---the-implications-of-equilibrium&quot;&gt;Introducing a Disturbance - The Implications of Equilibrium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flower-disturbance.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flower-disturbance-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model allows for a disturbance to remove 20% of the flowers. The “Disturbance” Converter is linked with a newly added “Disturbance Flow” that will enact on the 15th year of the simulation. The “Total Area” internal variable has been changed to a Stock in the model. The model was set for a duration of 20 years to indicate if equilibrium would be reached, but the added “Disturbance” only reduced the “Flowered Area” for the year it was enacted. The flowers gradually reached back to their apex of 800 acres 5 years after the “Disturbance” occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modeling Yellow Fever: Propositions for Mosquito Control Program vs. Isolation &amp; Incubation Program</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of this project is to illustrate the significance of model building and System Dynamics for epidemics - an applicable realization as the rapid spread of infectious diseases is a common trope throughout history. In fact, many epidemiologists predict that a pandemic the scale of the Spanish influenza will soon sweep the globe (Covid-19). Yellow Fever is transmitted through mosquitoes, specifically the Aedes aegypti species. Monitoring the infected is complicated; this viral disease has different impacts on each person, making predictions on the duration and severity of Yellow Fever difficult to pinpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models below simulate the proliferation of Yellow Fever through varying scenarios and mitigation techniques. While each case offers a new lens on predicting the spread of the viral disease, they all follow a similar backstory: urban diaspora. Individuals will contract Yellow Fever and bring it back to a populated urban center. If the infected person is bitten by a mosquito not carrying the disease, that mosquito will now become contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These simulations are adaptations of a Dynamo model for Yellow Fever outbreaks by Kjell Kalgraf. The figure below is the blueprint for this project’s modified simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kalgraf-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalgraf’s model is based on a real outbreak of Yellow Fever in Veracruz, Mexico (1899). The  population of Veracruz was nearly 20,000 people at the time. As the viral disease swept through the urban center, many casualties were suffered - 460 people died every month at the peak of the epidemic. The model predicts the mosquito population to be roughly 500,000. Kalgraf uses this outbreak as a hypothesis of sorts; he garners data based on population sizes, lifecycle of mosquitoes, estimated bites per day, and the rates of contraction and recovery, to model the severity of Yellow Fever. Ultimately, this is shown through the comparison of cumulative number of deaths and the surviving, immune population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters set for mosquitoes are as follows. 27,778 mosquitoes emerge into adulthood per day. At the height of the epidemic, there are a total of 500,000 mosquitoes. The lifespan of a mosquito is 18 days; 4 ‘blood feeds’ are needed throughout their lifetime. Ergo, the average mosquito feeds off 0.2 persons per day - leaving roughly 100,000 bites happening per day. It’s discovered that if mosquitoes don’t bite humans who are infected within their first three days, they are incapable of carrying Yellow Fever for the remainder of their lifetime. However, if mosquitoes feed off an infected person within the first 3 days (the initial period) of contracting Yellow Fever, they will carry the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters set for humans are a little more straightforward. A human can only contract Yellow Fever if they are bitten by a mosquito carrying the disease - it cannot be spread by another human. There are three stages to monitoring a disease: Incubation period, Contagious period, and Sick period. An infected person will enter an Incubation period (the # of days between infection and signs of symptoms) for 4.5 days. This is followed by a Contagious period of another 4.5 days, and a Sick period lasting 2.5 days. 90% of humans will recover and become immune to Yellow Fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-yellow-fever-based-on-kalgrafs-predictions---the-human-population&quot;&gt;Modeling Yellow Fever Based on Kalgraf’s Predictions - The Human Population&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yellow-fever-human.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model is a subset of Kalgraf’s original model described prior, with emhasis on the human population. The population follows Kalgraf’s study of Veracruz - out of 20,000 people, 100 are ascribed the Incubated phase leaving 19,900 vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/vulnerable-vs-sick.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time series model illustrates the human population’s exposure to Yellow Fever over 280 days. During the initial stages of the epidemic, there is an exponential increase in sick people as people carrying Yellow Fever are unaware in the first 4-5 days. However, as the population starts to incubate and follow proper isolation procedures, a linear decline in vulerable people appears. The amount of sick people tapers off as the amount of vulnerable people declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/immune-vs-deaths.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time series model denotes Kalgraf’s overarching goal - to model the number of people who survive Yellow Fever and become immune, versus the number of cumulative deaths. It parallels the 90% survival rate of the disease; 18,000 people are survive and become immune, and 2,000 people die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing just the human population in Kalgraf’s model allows for a more granular understanding of the implications associated with Yellow Fever outbreak rates and human recovery rates. For instance, the model assumes the amount of bites received by infected mosquitoes per day will remain constant over time. In reality, the amount of bites per infected mosquito will oscillate; as the human population begins building immunity, the rate of infected mosquitoes will decline - and so will the bites received per day. Moreover, holding the stages of Yellow Fever (incubated, contagious, and sick) at finite increments poses issues. For example, recovery rates will differ among person to person. While using Veracruz, Mexico as a case study allowed for predicting the diaspora of Yellow Fever in urban centers, and a better understanding of human recovery rate with real data, it’s important to note the prevalence of the city’s climate for mosquito reproduction. The tropical climate with little variation from season to season is ideal for mosquitoes. Places like Veracruz with high rates of precipitation and overall higher temperatures, will experience a greater possibility of infected mosquitoes - and therefore higher rates of bites per day. Places with similar climate’s to this case study will be exposed to greater rates of Yellow Fever outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-yellow-fever---kalgrafs-full-model&quot;&gt;Modeling Yellow Fever - Kalgraf’s Full Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yellow-fever-full.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a working model of Kalgraf’s diagram in its entirety. The parameters set for humans follows the nuanced modeling of the ‘Human Population’ segment above - initialized with 100 incubating humans, and 19,900 vulnerable humans. The emerging mosquito flow in the model represents the 27,778 mosquitoes Kalgraf predicted reach adulthood and can carry Yellow Fever. Out of the 500,000 mosquitoes, 417,000 denote ‘safe mosquitoes.’ The remaining 83,000 represent ‘new mosquitoes.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphs below offer visual aide to Kalgraf’s model through the lens of 3 scenarios: Cumulative Deaths (humans) vs Vulnerable Population, Cumulative Death during the outbreak, and Infectious Mosquitoes vs Cumulative Deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model above illustrates simulated values for the number of casualities experienced during the Yellow Fever outbreak. The peak number of deaths experienced per day is 18 people, and occurs around day 140 of the 280-day outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mendocino Fire Complex: Calculating Surface Vegetation Fluctuations through Spectral Indices (NDVI &amp; NBR)</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research delves into the complexities associated with measuring fire’s impact on an ecosystem, through the scope of vegetation health and re-growth. This study explores fluctuations in the condition of surface vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), of Mendocino County before, during, and after the emersion of the Mendocino Fire Complex. In addition, burn severity was calculated through the spectral index of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which utilizes reflectance data directly before and shortly after the emergence of a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mendocino Fire Complex was California’s largest wildlife in state history, and was comprised of two fires: The Ranch Fire and the River Fire. It consumed over 450,000 acres. The Complex surfaced on July 27th, 2018 and persisted until its containment on October 4th, 2018. The continuation of the Complex is most likely attributed to California’s Mediterranean climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Landsat TM images were obtained before the Complex emerged, and after it was contained (Path 45 Row 33: July 10; Path 45 Row 32: July 10; Path 45 Row 32: October 30; Path 45 Row 33: October 30).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) was utilized for its accentuation on regions of chlorophyll that exhibit the highest rates of reflectance and absorption. NDVI is calculated by the following formula: (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED). The resulting change in NDVI values was obtained from subtracting the post-fire values with the before-fire values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) estimates burn severity and highlights burned regions. NBR is calculated by the following formula: (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR). By subtracting the post-fire image with the pre-fire image, the dNBR image is obtained. The images were calibrated to the top-of- atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and radiometrically calibrated to account for brightness temperature. This allowed for clouds and shadows to be removed from the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/After-NDVI.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This map illustrates the calculated change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values across the burned areas after the Mendocino Complex’s dissipation. It was calculated by finding the difference of post-fire NDVI values and pre-fire NDVI values. These values are derived from Landsat 8 imagery provided by USGS Earth Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/NBR.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This map illustrates the calculated change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values across the burned areas after the Mendocino Complex’s dissipation. It was calculated by finding the difference of post-fire NDVI values and pre-fire NDVI values. These values are derived from Landsat 8 imagery provided by USGS Earth Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As predicted, Mendocino County experienced high NDVI values prior to the Complex, and a substantial decrease in NDVI values after the Complex. NDVI values prior to the Complex on July 10th were moderately high, taking into account the effect of California’s mediterranean climate. The lack of precipitation in the year 2018, coupled with intensified temperature values during the dry summer season, explain for the pre-complex mean NDVI value of 0.33, post-complex mean NDVI value of 0.08, and total change mean NDVI value of -0.24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this research was to unveil the changes in vegetation cover over the Mendocino National Forest and surrounding areas in Mendocino County, after the surfacing of California’s largest wildfire in state history: The Mendocino Fire Complex. This was achieved through analyzing the difference in vegetation cover change by comparing NDVI values with the spectral indices of NBR. Pre-fire vegetation experiences high NIR reflectance and low SWIR reflectance, while post-fire vegetation experiences low NIR reflectance and a high SWIR response. The region’s overall high dNBR values illustrate an intense burning, with seldom areas experiencing negative values and the associated increase in vegetation regrowth. Seasonal variations were outside the scope of this research, due to the relatively small change in spectral signatures during California’s dry period (from July to August).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>California's Most Destructive Wildfire: Mapping The Tubbs Fire (2017)</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using remotely sensed images for at-risk areas - like those entrenched in wildfires - is essential for monitoring vegetation indices and mitigating the fire’s destructive spread. This project examines the Tubbs Wildfire that devastated Sonoma County, CA in October of 2017. Three objectives were set for the parameters of this project’s success: measuring active and burnt area extent using thermal imagery, comparing NDVI fluctuations for vegetation health with fire activity, and illustrating post-fire social and structural implications for Sonoma County. This presentation was culminated in tandem with the following peers from the University of California, Los Angeles: Shannon Cavanaugh, Austin Gates, Mikayla Hart, Jaclyn Villars Klaus, and Madeline Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California’s Meditteranean climate makes it susceptible to “fire seasons” - large quantities of rainfall are collected in the winter, followed by a hot and dry summer that essentially leaves blooming vegetation left to dry out and become fuel for fires. In addition to drying vegetation, wind systems such as the Diablo and Santa Ana winds circulate through Northern and Southern California. The Diablo winds in Northern California bring hot, dry air that originate offshore due to high pressure over the land and low pressure over the ocean. The Santa Ana’s in Southern California bring similar hot, dry winds that stem from high pressures inland. The prevalence of these wind circulations is felt strongest during the months of September through December - now denoted as California’s “fire season.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most damaging fires in California was the Tubbs Fire (2017). The fire started on October 8th and quickly spread throughout Sonoma County and Napa County, burning a total of 36,807 acres until its full containment on October 31st. To accurately assess the breadth of the Tubb’s Fire, critical hotspots were georeferenced and thermal anomalies were detected using Landsat8’s thermal infrared band 10. This is an effective method in mapping a fire’s intensity and burn severity, because the thermal emissivity of an active fire is greater than that of its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used to detect and measure the extent of wilfires by using the photosynethic activity of vegetation as an indicator of a fire’s emersion. NDVI uses the Near Infrared and Red spectral bands to measure healthy vegetation based on the principle that photosynthetic organisms absorb most Red light, and reflect most Near Infrared light. NDVI values in burned areas were found to be significantly lower than unburned areas. In this study, MODIS sensors were used to compare the change in NDVI during the Tubbs Fire with average annual values from the same region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that the thermal bands will provide an accurate active fire extent and allow sensors to identify critical areas of the fire, as the extreme temperature of fire should provide a radiant flux easily distinguishable from the surrounding landscape. It is also expected that lower NDVI values represent lower vegetation production as burned vegetation will no longer reflect Near Infrared light or absorb Red light to the comparison of healthy vegetation. It is anticipated that the recovery effort will be difficult and slow in the Santa Rosa region, due to the sheer number of structures destroyed (5,100).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before explaining the process in its entirety, it’s imperative to first understand the basics of thermal remote sensing. Every object on Earth with an internal temperature greater tha absolute zero emits unique thermal infrared energy, know as Radiant Flux. Thermal infrared energy extends from 3-14μm on the spectral scale. Unfortunately, we are not able to utilize this full range; atmospheric interference is a limited factor. H20, CO2, and O3 form absorption bands that preoccupy a signficant amount of thermal infrared radiation between 3-14μm. This creates atmospheric windows in the electromagnetic spectrum for sensors. The Earth’s ozone layer absorbs much of the thermal energy exiting the terrain in an absorption band from approximately 9 - 10μm. This leaves the window from 10.5 - 12.5μm to avoid the absorption band. We will utilize Landsat8’s Band 10 which occurs from 10.6 - 11.19μm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of cost and resolution, the best imagery accessible was Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level-1. This sensor provides 11 bands at 30m spatial resolution, capturing the entirety of Earth every 16 days. The sensor follows a near polar orbit, capturing 400 scenes per day and completing over 14 orbits. This both reduces the risk of cloud interference and creates the possibility of scene overlap for analysis purposes. Landsat 8 thermal infrared is acquired at 100m resolution and resampled to 30m resolution. Although Landsat 8 provides two thermal bands, Bands 10 and 11, users should refrain from relying on Band 11 data for quantitative anlysis. Band 11 adheres to larger calibration uncertainty, contaminated by stray light from outside the field of view. Using Glovis, a product by USGS, this study was able to come to fruition through the comparison of two scenes captured on October 11, 2017 and October 12, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature threshold were created by comparing the Digital Number (DN) pixel values in the area we knew the Tubbs Fire scorched with DN pixel values of the surrounding, unscathed area. To isolate active fire pixels from the rest of the scene, the threshold of DN values set for October 11th was 31,750 and the threshold of DN values set for October 12th was 24,750. These values were converted to represent a range approximating 290K-360K using the Temperature Retrieval Algorithm provided by the Landsat wesbite. This range represents “Top of Atomosphere (TOA) Brightness Temperature,” not Land Surface Temperature. Converting TOA Brightness Temperature to Land Surface Temperature is possible, but often provides inaccurate estimation due to water vapor interference and emissivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the thresholds for both scenes were finalized, the images obtained on October 11, 2017 and October 12, 2017 were imported into Arcmap. The images were reclassified, and a new raster was created with all pixel values under the threshold parameters ascribed ‘null.’ Polygons representing DN values greater than the thresholds were produced using a raster-to-vector conversion. These polygons, labeled ‘Thermal Anomalies,’ were then overlaid on both original thermal images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the impact the Tubbs Fire had on vegetation, our study needed a large range of NDVI values during and after the fire with the norms for the same time span in previous years. The product eMODIS V6 NDVI was selected to perform calculations and evaluate the annual comparison. The MODIS vegetation indices were calculated based on 16-day intervales of daily assessements with Red and Near Infrared Bands. They were also corrected for Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Imagery was downloaded in 1-week intervals from USGS during the timeframe of September 26th through November 20th. The 8 images produced from this timeline were clipped with the shapefile of the Tubbs Fire’s extent. Zonal Statistics were calculated to aquire the median, mean, minimum, and maximum NDVI values for each week. The median values were used as the point of reference, determining the change each week. A choropleth map was chosen to visually represent the Tubbs Fire’s effect on vegetation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confirm the correlation between decreasing NDVI values with an increasing Tubbs Fire extent (and not just normalcy of decreasing vegetation for this time of year), median NDVI values for the same 8-week period were calculated for the year prior (2016) using the same process. Line charts comparing the ‘Weekly Median NDVI Value’ for September 26 - November 20 were created to compare the change in NDVI before the Tubbs Fire (2016) and during the Tubbs Fire (2017). To further cement this correlation, this process was done for the same weeks for the years 2014 and 2015. A declining slope of the tredline illustrates a decrease in NDVI, while a positive slope denotes an increase in NDVI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to gauge recovery efforts of the Tubbs Fire, demographic maps were produced to showcase the rapid movement of the fire from the less populated wine country of Napa County to the densely populated, urbanized region of Sonoma County. The two demographics of interest for the study were population and income. The Tubbs Fire polygon was layered with demographic data provided from the 2010 US Census.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Thermal Anomalies’ in the map above represent DN pixels greater than the threshold set for the image captured on October 11, 2017 (31,750). The TOA Brightness Temperature equivalent to this threshold ranges from 306.25K - 367.12K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map above represents the burned area of the Tubbs Fire’s extent at its apex - October 10th through October 15th. Shapefiles of the boundaries were provided from a Cal Fire Server. The polygons were then separated by date to illustrate a 5-day choropleth map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ndvi-analysis---tubbs-fire-boundary&quot;&gt;NDVI Analysis - Tubbs Fire Boundary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tubbs-ndvi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composite of 8 maps above illustrate a side-by-side comparison of the weekly change in NDVI values for the Tubbs Fire’s extent between September 26, 2017 and November 20, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weekly-median-ndvi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a year before the Tubbs fire occurred, the extent showcased a slight increase in vegetation health (NDVI values). This increase in vegetation health is heavily juxtaposed by the following year’s (2017) indices. As expected, the fire catalyzed an ongoing regression of vegetation health (characterized by the prominent downward trend in NDVI values).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/yearly-median-ndvi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add another facet of understanding to our analysis, a calculation of vegetation health in the years 2014 and 2015 was further examined. This analysis served as a safety precaution of sorts: if the vegetation health of the extent (multiple years prior to the Tubbs fire’s outbreak) showed an apparent decrease, there had to be other outside factors influencing these oscillations. However, these prior years followed the same trajectory of 2016 — an overall increase in vegetation health. Ergo, the clear decrease in NDVI values in the year 2017 was an outcome of the Tubbs fire’s devastation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;income-analysis&quot;&gt;Income Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tubbs-income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustration represents the Mean Annual Income of areas impacted by the Tubbs Fire. An income analysis helps aide the recovery efforts placed in order after the Tubbs Fire was fully contained. The burned area in the figure above indicates a considerably financially stable representation of people affected. Only two of thirteen census tracts were represented as ‘Red’ with a mean annual income lower than $58,000. The national mean average income is approximately $51,939 so the two tracts within the lowest income range exceeds that of the national average. Five of thirteen census tracts denote incomes greater than $100,000 - which only 20% of the American population makes. Understanding the wealth in the affected area helps assume higher rates of recovery; most people within this income ranges can afford home insurance and other amenities that will likely make recovery easier. If the Tubbs Fire had occurred in an area with substantially lower annual income averages, it is probable that longer rates of recovery and rebuilding would occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tubbs-population.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map above illustrates the Tubbs Fire’s spread from a less populated region (Napa County) to a more clustered population in Sonoma County. This emphasizes the amount of people affected by the Tubbs Fire’s destruction, and the reason it was coined ‘California’s Most Destructive Wildfire’ in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the data, it was unanimous that while Landsat 8 certaintly allows for the identification of thermal anomalies such as wildfires, perhaps an AVIRIS-like hyperspectral sensor would have been more accommodating for this analysis. There are many limitations to remotely sensing wildfires thermally - including spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions, as well as interference from scattering and emissivity. It is important to remember that Landsat 8 TIRS bands are acquired at 100m resolution, but are then resampled to 30m. While the spatial resolution provides a mean area of estimation, the precision of the active fire area is jeopardized by the resampled area - which could provide misconstrued data for fire crews in their attempt to mitigate the Tubbs Fire. Temporally, one or two scenes every 16 days will not allow daily mapping of the active fire regions. And spectrally, the small atmospheric windows sensing thermal infrared energy are limiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touched upon above, interference and scattering also affect sensors outside Earth’s atmosphere. In addition to the atmospheric windows an orbital sensor must work within, the amount of smoke produced by fires hinder a thermal sensor’s ability to accurately sense an active fire’s area. Due to the large diameter of smoke particles, Mie Scatterring occurs - when the diameters of atmospheric particles are so similar to the wavelength of scattering light that the thermal infrared wavelengths do not reach the sensors. Cloud cover can also alter data, as water vapor non selectively scatters all wavelengths and limits the sensor’s ability to collect data. There may also be light contamination in the thermal infrared bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless if a hyperspectral sensor like AVIRIS was equipped to a geostationary satellite with finer spatial resolution (10m-20m), there will always be a variable impeding thermal measurements. Iterference and scattering from clouds, smoke, and atmospheric gas will always be considered when performing calculations and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Urban Applications of Supervised Classification: Landsat vs. MODIS of Los Angeles, CA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This project underscores the necessity of using high spatial resolution sensors when mapping urban centers, by contrasting a fine-resolution Landsat8 image with a medium-resoltion MODIS image in Los Angeles. This exploration of using different spatial resolutions is coupled with the introduction of Supervised Classification, as we examine varying land cover types embedded in an urban setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervised Classification allows more autonomy than its counterpart, Unsupervised Classification. A Supervised Classification gives the creator the ability to designate specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the image that correspond to different land cover types. The user can then specify the amount of pixel values or spectral indices for each class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obtaining-the-data&quot;&gt;Obtaining The Data:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 Landsat images (Landsat8 OLI) were obtained through the USGS Global Visual Viewer (Glovis), with the approximate coordinates set for Los Angeles (LAT: 34, LON: -118). The time period isolated was November 5th, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MODIS images were provided by NASA Reverb. An 8-day composite was selected (MODIS Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day L3 Global 250m). MODIS imagery is available in 250m resolution - the one selected for this study - with 2 bands available: Near-Infrared (NIR) and Red. MODIS imagery is also available in 500m resoolution with 6 bands. I decided to sacrifice having a higher spectral resolution for a finer spatial resolution, and used 2 bands (NIR &amp;amp; Red) for the classification. The 8-day composite downloaded corresponds best with the Landsat November 5th image, taken between the dates of November 1st and November 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the pixel values for Band 1 and Band 2 - as well as units, wavelength range, spectral signature, and spatial resolution - between the Landsat image and MODIS image is imperative for the success of this project. Through careful analysis, it was decided that Landsat’s Band 4 (Red) and band 5 (NIR) were most comparable with the 250m MODIS data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-data-for-classification---landsat-vs-modis&quot;&gt;Preparing Data for Classification - Landsat vs MODIS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Supervised-Landsat.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Supervised-Modis.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in preparing the Landsat image for classification was stacking Band 4 and Band 5 together. The next step was to subset our newly stacked image. The general Los Angeles area needed to have prominent features - like the Bob Hope Airport (North West Corner), Rose Bowl Stadium (North East Corner), Santa Monica Pier (South West Corner), and LAX (South East Corner). A Polygon ROI including these 4 features was created, and the data was subset for the ROI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly subset Landsat image was loaded using RGB = 5,4,4. The MODIS image was re-projected, subset to the same region as the Landsat image, and loaded with the band combination RGB = 2,1,1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dominant colors in the image above are varying shades of red - some appearing as a darker maroon, others a bright red. Red seems to denote the vegetation in the ROI, the brightest red seen in the image above signifying agricultural fields and golf courses. There are also shades of white and grey spread intermittently throughout the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;supervised-classificaiton---maximum-likelihood-landsat-vs-modis&quot;&gt;Supervised Classificaiton - Maximum Likelihood (Landsat vs MODIS)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Maximum-Likelihood-Landsat.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Maximum-Likelihood-Modis.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supervised Classification used was ‘Maximum Likelihood,’ which assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are normally distributed. The computer algorithm then calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class. Each pixel is assigned to the class with the highest probability (the maximum likelihood).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining pixels in the image are classified by the Supervised Classification algorithm using training ROIs - which the user designates as the representation of each land cover class. 5 land cover classes were created for the images: Urban, Ocean, Mountains, Golf Courses, and Sand. The variation in number of ROIs created determine how many land cover types will be classified in the image. The more specific the ROI, the better the classification. A careful balance between covering enough pixels to spectrally represent each land cover type - and coverying too large of an area that you lose specificity - must be maintained when classifying the ROI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training ROIs were created for the images according to their band cominations - RGB = 4,3,3 (Landsat) and RGB = 2,1,1 (MODIS). When setting up the Maximum Likelihood Classification, regions were designated as separate classes and the Probability Threshold was set to ‘None.’ These classification were then overlayed onto the orignally stacked image for evaluation. When the land cover types for both Landat and MODIS images matched, statistics and histograms were computed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landsat achieves a much higher resolution for identifying nuanced areas, such as urban dwellings. This is why Landsat is often used for spatial objects. MODIS, on the other hand, would be preferred when analyzying temporal settings - like a daily land cover change among urban dwelling. The largest visible difference of classification between the Landsat and MODIS image was between mountain ranges. This may be because the Supervised Classification over-classified these large regions - it denoted general areas as ‘mountains’ that were nearby roads or urban dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;histogram-and-statistics-for-classification---landsat-vs-modis&quot;&gt;Histogram and Statistics for Classification - Landsat vs. MODIS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/landsat-vs-modis-stats.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart above uses statistics and histograms to showcase the two differing sensors’ ability to classify land cover type for the subset ROI. Landsat 8 had a mean of 2.88, with a standard deviation of 1.16. MODIS had a mean of 3.70, with a standard deviation of 1.22. The DN associated with each land cover type is shown through the histogram breakdown of the chart. The final portion of the chart - “Total Area Change” - is calculated by subtracting the area from Landsat 8 classification with the area from MODIS classification. Negative values, like those for Golf Course, Ocean, and Sand, represent a gross overestimation of land cover type by the differing sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Water Resource Analysis: Lake Change Detection of the Tibetan Plateau</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This project accentuates one of Remote Sensing’s most important facets: Change Detection Mapping. More specifically, a water resource analysis of lake change detection. The ROI is the Tibetan Plateau - one of the world’s most vulnerable areas to global change. There is a pronounced temperature rise of 0.16°C every decade. It’s clear the Tibetan lakes are experiencing alternations in their distribution and inundation area; however, the Tibetan Plateau’s inhospitable environment and general lack of accessibility have left lake dynamics shrowded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landsat imagery taken over the course of 25 years were used to map and detect multi-decadal changes of a particular lake in the Tibetan Plateau: Dawa Co. This small, saline lake is approximately 115km and located in the heart of the Tibetan Plateau. A much smaller satellite lake (roughly 8km) is viewable East of Dawa Co. A series of images were acquired during the same season by 3 different Landsat sensors: Landsat MSS (1976), Landsat TM (1990), and Landsat ETM+ (2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-the-image&quot;&gt;Preparing The Image:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Region of Interest (ROI) was created around the Dawa Co. and satellite lake. The Landsat MSS image was subset using the ROI, and acted as our base of reference - a template of sorts for later subsetting the Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ images. Aggregatting and Subsetting the Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ images were essentially for performing lake change detection. Landsat TM and ETM+ images need resampling because their images are a much finer resolution than Landsat MSS. To compromise with the much coarser spatial resolution of the Landsat MSS image, the pixel sizes of Landsat TM and ETM+ were resized and resampled to match the pixel size of the Landsat MSS image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these varying sensors offer different perspectives of the ROI, adjustments in band ratios need to be performed. For instance, both Landsat MSS and Landsat ETM+ images showcase the Northern 1/3rd of the satellite lake very light in color. This is due to the sensors picking up high amounts of salt sediment on the bottom of the lake. The Landset ETM+ image, on the other hand, shows little of this salty bottom. Band Ratio Adjusment is performed to reduce this bottom effect using the following formula: (b1x100/(b2+1)). The variable b1 in the formula is defined as Band 4, and b2 is ascribed to Band 3. This readjustment was performed for all Landsat sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this Lake Change Detection project was defining the Spectral Threshold for water. The lakes from the surrounding land mass in the ratio image were extracted, and histograms were created for the ratio Landsat TM, MSS, and ETM+ images. These histograms helped define the data value threshold break between water and land for the images.
The Estimated Threshold Breaks for the sensors were as followed:
	Landsat TM: 61
	Landsat MSS: 54
	Landsat ETM+: 64&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change Detection is visually represented through a classification scheme - operations achieved through ‘Color Mapping’ and ‘Density Slicing.’ The original range was deleted, and new ranges were added that span from 0 to the Threshold Value of the image. Post-Classification Corrections were also performed on the image, due to lake area’s containing isolated pixels (‘speckle’). These were removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the images were corrected, they were combined together into one composite RGB image. This allows for an easy visualization of the change detection between each image.
	Landsat MSS image was set to ‘R’
	Landsat TM image was set to ‘G’
	Landsat ETM+ image was set to ‘B’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Linear Stretch was applied to the stacked image for a proper representation - at first the image displays as black. Statistics and Histograms are calculated for each of the three final classifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-detection-mapping&quot;&gt;Change Detection Mapping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lake-detection.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors illsutrated in the RGB composite image above showcase the change in the lakes’ size throughout the years (1976, 1990, and 2000). The lakes’ extent in the first year (1976) is denoted by the Red coloring (Landsat MSS - R:1, G:0, B:0). The lakes’ extent in the second year (1990) is denoted by the Yellow coloring (Landsat TM - R:1, G:1, B:0). The lakes’ extent in the final year (2000) is denoted by the White coloring (Landsat ETM+ : R:1, G:1, B:1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of “1” changes in accordance to which layer is placed on top of one another. This is why the lakes’ extent in the most recent year (2000) has a value of “1” for the three RGB Bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through Change Detection Mapping, we can deduce that Dawa Co. and its surrounding satellite lake are experiencing different directions of change - in fact, they’re inverses of each other. Dawa Co. is decreasing in size, while the satellite lake is increasing. This difference in size is illustrated by which colors are categorized by the value “1” for RBG. The unanimous RBG value of “1” (R:1, G:1, B:1) for the satellite lake solidifes its increasing size. The furthest extent is represented by the Dark Blue area, with values of R:0, G:0, B:1. The middle extent is categorized by the Light Blue area, with values of R:0, G:1, B:1. The shortest extent is denoted by the White area, with values of R:1, G:1, B:1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark blue area denotes the furthest extent, its value being R:0, G:0, B:1. The value categorized as B, ETM+, denotes the most recent image of the lake in year 2000. The light blue area denotes the middle extent of the lake, and its size is determined by the TM 1990 image (its value being R:0, G:1, B:1). The satellite lake’s smallest white extent is categorized with the RGB value: R: 1, G:1, B:1. This indicates that the extent was observed by the 3 satellite images listed above (TM, MSS, ETM+). Based on the values of these bands, the direction of the size appears to be increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;statistics&quot;&gt;Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lake-stats.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics above help understand Lake Pixel Area Change over the 25 year duration. This change was calculated between the 1976 - 1990 images and between the 1990 - 2000 images. The Landsat MSS (1976) image had a Npts of 37,102. Landsat TM (1990) has a Npts of 35,887. The difference between these values allows for a total Lake Pixel Area Change of 1,215 over the course of 1976 to 1990. Subtracting Landsat TM’s (1990) Npts of 35,887 with Landsat ETM+ (2000) Npts of 35,308 gave us the final Lake Pixel Area Change of 579. This lower Pixel Change makes sense, since the timeframe between the Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ images are less than the 1976 - 1990 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analysis of Topographic Data: DEM of Mt. Whitney, CA using SRTM Imagery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This project unveils the prevalence in using 3D representations of the Earth’s surface: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Elevation data for MT. Whitney, CA was obtained through the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) - a mission that garnered a near-global scale, high-resolution digital topographic database of Earth. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar sysstem (C-Band and X-Band) that flew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor during an 11-day mission in February of 2000. As a result of this effort, three resolutions were produced: 30 arc second (1km), 3 arc second (90km), and 1 arc second (10m).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-the-image&quot;&gt;Preparing The Image:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images produced below showcase DEM’s prevalence for 2 types of modeling: Elevation and Hydrological. These are seen through the creation of Elevation Profiles for MT. Whitney - the highest summit in the contiguous U.S. - and a Transect Profile for the largest river in its vicinity (Kern River).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of the DEM is the Kern River (N-S direction), with Owen’s Valley on the far right and MT. Whitney in-between the two. To highlight the highest elevations in the MT. Whitney area, a density slice was performed and overlayed on the original image. The default classification for the density slice was used; however, the ranges were customized to parallel the elevation of MT. Whitney. The range’s starting point was set to 4,000, and its ending point was set to MT. Whitney’s maximum elevation point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevation and Vertical Profiles were created to better understand the topography of MT. Whitney. An Elevation Transect was produced to get a closer look at the flow of water in the Kern River. A Hillshade Model was created to accentuate the elevation of MT. Whitney, and grasp the sun’s impact on remotely sensed images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;analyzing-horizontal--vertical-profiles---mt-whitney-ca&quot;&gt;Analyzing Horizontal &amp;amp; Vertical Profiles - Mt. Whitney, CA&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Topographic-Data-Profiles.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horizontal and vertical profiles in the graphs above are particular to MT. Whitney’s topographical layout. They showcase the oscillations in elevation throughout a continous distance, sharing the same topography. An analysis between the two profiles uncovers the relationship between elevation and distance. The horizontal profile indicates a decrease in elevation the further the distance from MT. Whitney’s peak. The vertical profile prove its counterpart - an increase in elevation the closer to MT. Whitney’s peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;elevation-transect---kern-river&quot;&gt;Elevation Transect - Kern River&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Elevation-Transect.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image extracted from SRTM is helpful in analyzing the elevation transect of the Kern River, because DEMs allow for easy extraction of drainage networks (hydrological modeling). Graphing the spatial profile of Kern River allows for a palpable representation of the water’s flow - Southward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;considerations-for-sun-positioning---application-of-colored-hill-shade&quot;&gt;Considerations for Sun Positioning - Application of Colored Hill Shade&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Colored-Hillshade.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hill Shade models are created for consideration of possible topographic changes due to the sun’s positioning. The sun elevation angle is how high the sun is positioned in the sky. The sun azimuth angle describes which direction the sun is coming from - with North as 0° increasing clockwise to 360°. These two contrasting images of the same hill shade model illustrate the necessity in understanding the sun’s impact on DEMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hill shade model on the left represents an elevation angle set to 90° and an azimuth angle set to 360°. With these parameters, the sun’s setting is essentially on the horizon (the northern region). This is a plausible scenario for projecting the sun’s impact on a remotely sensed image, given the sun’s placement within a 90° incremental oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hill shade model on the right represents an elevation angle set to 10° and an azimuth angle set to 0°. These unrealistic parameters were set to emphasize the importance in comprehending practical scenarios for the sun’s positioning. The image on the right is dark in color - no sun in sight. This makes sense, because the sun doesn’t set in the North.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Active Remote Sensing: Interpolation &amp; Analysis of SAR Imagery</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-of-sar-images--lidar-data---applications-of-a-gaussian-contrast-stretch&quot;&gt;Analysis of SAR Images &amp;amp; LiDAR Data - Applications of a Gaussian Contrast Stretch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/active-rs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project emphasizes the strength in Active Remote Sensing - satellites capable of generating their own source of energy through electromagnetic radiation. The use of interpolation and analysis of SAR (Synthetic-aperture Radar) was used to obtain latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for the image center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of a ‘Gaussian Contrast Stretch’ was used on the orginal image, which adds a gray filter to make darker pixels appear brighter and show less contrast. These constrasting representations of the same image highlight the basics of interpreting satellite imagery of urban centers. Rivers appear darker because a large portion of the radar’s energy is being reflected away from the sensor - the flat surface acting like a mirror. Buildings, on the other hand, appear almost overwhelmingly bright. This common occurrence is often referred to as the “Corner Reflection Effect.” When two smooth surfaces form a 90° angle that faces the beam shot from active satellites, it’s as if twice the energy is being reflected off the object and reflected back to the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Gaussian-histogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Histograms are useful graphic representations for remotely sensed images, because they allow for the analysis of a single band. Analyzing the input and output histograms from the Gaussian Contrast image (left) to the original image (right) allows for a heightened understanding of 3 statistical variables: Range, Central Tendency, and Distribution. In the realm of remote sensing, the Range refers to frequency of pixels and is always a value between 0 and 255. The Central Tendency is represented as a single value that denotes an entire dataset by its center. In this case, the Central Tendency for the Gaussian Stretch image is 122, while the 2% Linear Stretch of the original image is 29. The Distribution of the Guassian Stretch image appears normal, while the 2% Linear Stretch of the original image is skewed to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unsupervised Classification: Land Cover Types in Los Angeles, CA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This project highlights the importance of using an Unsupervised Classification when dealing with vegetation. In particular, performing and interpreting Unsupervised Classification of differing land cover types in Los Angeles through Landsat 7 images. Unsupervised Classification is computer automated, with the user dictating the number of Classes represented, as well as Maximum Iterations (how many times the algorithm runs) and the Change Threshold Percentage (when the algorithm stops for the next classification to emerge). These classes represent the number of pixels for each band represented in the image. Clustering algorithms group the pixels together based on spectral similarities. When the classification is finalized, coloring is added to the image. This makes interpreting the classification easier for the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-the-images&quot;&gt;Preparing The Images:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landsat 7 images were subset, recalibrated, and stacked. Spatially subsetting the image allows for a specific portion to be analyzed at a more granular level. Landsat 7 images allow for the RGB combination (bands 4,3,2) to come to the forefront of our analysis. There is heavy empahsis on band 4 (red) in the Landsat image, as we will be taking a closer look at Vegetation Indices (NDVI). Recalibrating the image is crucial for minimizing the path radiance for particular bands. Statistic paramenters are computed by running simple statistics on the original bands and subset bands. Each of these newly recalibrated bands are then ‘stacked’ together with the subset image bands into a single image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ndvi-analysis&quot;&gt;NDVI Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/unsupervised-ndvi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map GIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is paramount for properly interpreting an area’s vegetation cover. NDVI is calculated by subtracting the Near-Infrared Band (NIR) with the Red Band, and then dividing that total with the value obtained from adding the NIR Band with the Red Band. Brighter pixel values in the image above correspond to higher rates of photosynthesis - in essence, the brighter the pixel equates to the greater amount of ‘healthy’ vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;isodata-algorithm&quot;&gt;Isodata Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/isodata.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer automated Isodata Algorithm for Unsupervised Classification calculates class means evenly distributed in the data space. It then iteratively clusters the remaining pixels using minimum distance techniques. Each iteration recalculates the mean, and reclassifies pixels with respect to the new means. This process continues until the number of pixels in each class changes by less than the selected pixel change threshold (or until the maximum number of iterations is reached).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stacked, subset image was set to the following parameters:
 	A minimum class value of 4 and maximum class value of 6.
 	Maximum number of iterations set to 6.
 	Threshold set to 5.
 	Minimum number of pixels per class set to 1,000.
 	Standard Deviation set to 1.
 	Minimum class distance set to 6.
 	Max number of merge pairs set to 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what land cover feature each class represents, a classified image showcasing an array of colors is overlayed on top of the stacked image. Countless experiments of re-running the classification is performed until the best classification of the area is developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/unsupervised-class.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red in the image (Class 1) predominately illsutrates bodies of water - lakes and oceans. The small portion of Red scattered among the Green denotes areas of extremely low net productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green in the image (Class 2) showcases areas of extremely high vegetation. These are most likely wilderness areas and areas with high productivity such as the Santa Monica Mountains and those near Santa Clarita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue in the image (Class 3) represents lighter areas of vegetation - like small agricultural fields, or shrubs and bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yellow in the image (Class 4) emblemizes the urban areas in Los Angeles - a city dominated with concrete. Things like buildings, roads, parking lots, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Light Blue (Class 5) illustrates varying areas of urban land cover. The color is distributed throughout the image in varying quantities, leading us to believe they’re areas with buildings and relatively low regions of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;histogram--statistics&quot;&gt;Histogram &amp;amp; Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hist-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hist-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Placeholder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing histograms and statistics is often the final part of the study, when the user is satisfied with the classification of the image. Histograms are efficient in showing the image’s most dominant classes (its frequency). The Y-Axis indicates this frequency by showcasing the amount of time it occurs, while the X-Axis indicates the data values (classes). The statistics shed light on the number of pixels within each class. The ‘DN’ (Digital Number) column in the image above represents each alternating class. The ‘Npts’ column illustrates the total pixels in each category (pixels per class). General statistics, like the mean and standard deviation, are also computed. The ‘Percent’ column shows the percentage of space taken up by each category.&lt;/p&gt;
