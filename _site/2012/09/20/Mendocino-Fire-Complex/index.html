This study explores fluctuations in the condition of surface vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), of Mendocino County before, during, and after the emersion of the Mendocino Fire Complex. In addition, burn severity was calculated through the spectral index of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which utilizes reflectance data directly before and shortly after the emergence of a fire.</p><p>The Mendocino Fire Complex was Californiaâ€™s largest wildlife in state history, and was comprised of two fires: The Ranch Fire and the River Fire. It consumed over 450,000 acres. The Complex surfaced on July 27th, 2018 and persisted until its containment on October 4th, 2018. The continuation of the Complex is most likely attributed to Californiaâ€™s Mediterranean climate.</p><h3 id="methods">Methods:</h3><p>Two Landsat TM images were obtained before the Complex emerged, and after it was contained (Path 45 Row 33: July 10; Path 45 Row 32: July 10; Path 45 Row 32: October 30; Path 45 Row 33: October 30).</p><p>Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) was utilized for its accentuation on regions of chlorophyll that exhibit the highest rates of reflectance and absorption. NDVI is calculated by the following formula: (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED). The resulting change in NDVI values was obtained from subtracting the post-fire values with the before-fire values.</p><p>Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) estimates burn severity and highlights burned regions. NBR is calculated by the following formula: (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR). By subtracting the post-fire image with the pre-fire image, the dNBR image is obtained. The images were calibrated to the top-of- atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and radiometrically calibrated to account for brightness temperature. This allowed for clouds and shadows to be removed from the images.</p><h3 id="results">Results:</h3><h3 id="mendocino-fire-complex">Mendocino Fire Complex</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/Mendo-GIS.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>Illustrated above are the two fires that account for the Mendocino Fire Complex (The Ranch Fire and the River Fire), as well as the boundaries of the Mendocino National Forest and Mendocino County.

NDVI values prior to the Complex on July 10th were moderately high, taking into account the effect of Californiaâ€™s mediterranean climate. The lack of precipitation in the year 2018, coupled with intensified temperature values during the dry summer season, explain for the pre-complex mean NDVI value of 0.33, post-complex mean NDVI value of 0.08, and total change mean NDVI value of -0.24.</p><p>The goal of this research was to unveil the changes in vegetation cover over the Mendocino National Forest and surrounding areas in Mendocino County, after the surfacing of Californiaâ€™s largest wildfire in state history: The Mendocino Fire Complex. This was achieved through analyzing the difference in vegetation cover change by comparing NDVI values with the spectral indices of NBR. Pre-fire vegetation experiences high NIR reflectance and low SWIR reflectance, while post-fire vegetation experiences low NIR reflectance and a high SWIR response. The regionâ€™s overall high dNBR values illustrate an intense burning, with seldom areas experiencing negative values and the associated increase in vegetation regrowth. Seasonal variations were outside the scope of this research, due to the relatively small change in spectral signatures during Californiaâ€™s dry period (from July to August).</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements:</h3><p>I would like to personally thank Dr. Nick Burkhart for being my advisor during the curation of my independent research.
