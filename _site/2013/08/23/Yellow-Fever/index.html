In fact, many epidemiologists predict that a pandemic the scale of the Spanish influenza will soon sweep the globe (Covid-19). Yellow Fever is transmitted through mosquitos, specifically the Aedes aegypti species. Monitoring the infected is complicated; this viral disease has different impacts on each person, making predictions on the duration and severity of Yellow Fever difficult to pinpoint.</p><p>The models below simulate the proliferation of Yellow Fever through varying scenarios and mitigation techniques. While each case offers a new lens on predicting the spread of the viral disease, they all follow a similar backstory: urban diaspora. Individuals will contract Yellow Fever and bring it back to a populated urban center. If the infected person is bitten by a mosquito not carrying the disease, that mosquito will now become contagious.</p><p>These simulations are adaptations of a Dynamo model for Yellow Fever outbreaks by Kjell Kalgraf. The figure below is the blueprint for this projectâ€™s modified simulations.</p><h2 id="kalgrafs-model">Kalgrafâ€™s Model</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/kalgraf-model.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>Kalgrafâ€™s model is based on a real outbreak of Yellow Fever in Veracruz, Mexico (1899). The population of Veracruz was nearly 20,000 people at the time. As the viral disease swept through the urban center, many casualties were suffered - 460 people died every month at the peak of the epidemic. The model predicts the mosquito population to be roughly 500,000. Kalgraf uses this outbreak as a hypothesis of sorts; he garners data based on population sizes, lifecycle of mosquitos, estimated bites per day, and the rates of contraction and recovery, to model the severity of Yellow Fever. Ultimately, this is shown through the comparison of cumulative number of deaths and the surviving, immune population.</p><p>The parameters set for mosquitos are as follows. 27,778 mosquitos emerge into adulthood per day. At the height of the epidemic, there are a total of 500,000 mosquitos. The lifespan of a mosquito is 18 days; 4 â€˜blood feedsâ€™ are needed throughout their lifetime. Ergo, the average mosquito feeds off 0.2 persons per day - leaving roughly 100,000 bites happening per day. Itâ€™s discovered that if mosquitos donâ€™t bite humans who are infected within their first three days, they are incapable of carrying Yellow Fever for the remainder of their lifetime. However, if mosquitos feed off an infected person within the first 3 days (the initial period) of contracting Yellow Fever, they will carry the disease.</p><p>The parameters set for humans are a little more straightforward. A human can only contract Yellow Fever if they are bitten by a mosquito carrying the disease - it cannot be spread by another human. There are three stages to monitoring a disease: Incubation period, Contagious period, and Sick period. An infected person will enter an Incubation period (the # of days between infection and signs of symptoms) for 4.5 days. This is followed by a Contagious period of another 4.5 days, and a Sick period lasting 2.5 days. 90% of humans will recover and become immune to Yellow Fever.</p><h3 id="the-feedback-loops-in-an-epidemic-model">The Feedback Loops in an Epidemic Model</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/feedback-loop.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>There are two feedback loops in the Yellow Fever model, both of which are Net Negative. The smaller loop on the far right alters the dyanmics of the model by adding a fraction of people who are vulnerable to Yellow Fever. The larger loop to the left takes the mosquito population as a whole into account - the mosquitos that newly emerge into adulthood, and the infection rates among humans as a result. Both an increase in vulnerable people and an increase in mosquitoe will have a negative result on the model.</p><h3 id="modeling-yellow-fever-based-on-kalgrafs-predictions---the-human-population">Modeling Yellow Fever Based on Kalgrafâ€™s Predictions - The Human Population</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/yellow-fever-human.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This model is a subset of Kalgrafâ€™s original model described prior, with emhasis on the human population. The population follows Kalgrafâ€™s study of Veracruz - out of 20,000 people, 100 are ascribed the Incubated phase leaving 19,900 vulnerable.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/vulnerable-vs-sick.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This time series model illustrates the human populationâ€™s exposure to Yellow Fever over 280 days. During the initial stages of the epidemic, there is an exponential increase in sick people as people carrying Yellow Fever are unaware in the first 4-5 days. However, as the population starts to incubate and follow proper isolation procedures, a linear decline in vulerable people appears. The amount of sick people tapers off as the amount of vulnerable people declines.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/immune-vs-deaths.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This time series model denotes Kalgrafâ€™s overarching goal - to model the number of people who survive Yellow Fever and become immune, versus the number of cumulative deaths. It parallels the 90% survival rate of the disease; 18,000 people are survive and become immune, and 2,000 people die.</p><p>Analyzing just the human population in Kalgrafâ€™s model allows for a more granular understanding of the implications associated with Yellow Fever outbreak rates and human recovery rates. For instance, the model assumes the amount of bites received by infected mosquitos per day will remain constant over time. In reality, the amount of bites per infected mosquito will oscillate; as the human population begins building immunity, the rate of infected mosquitos will decline - and so will the bites received per day. Moreover, holding the stages of Yellow Fever (incubated, contagious, and sick) at finite increments poses issues. For example, recovery rates will differ among person to person. While using Veracruz, Mexico as a case study allowed for predicting the diaspora of Yellow Fever in urban centers, and a better understanding of human recovery rate with real data, itâ€™s important to note the prevalence of the cityâ€™s climate for mosquito reproduction. The tropical climate with little variation from season to season is ideal for mosquitos. Places like Veracruz with high rates of precipitation and overall higher temperatures, will experience a greater possibility of infected mosquitos - and therefore higher rates of bites per day. Places with similar climateâ€™s to this case study will be exposed to greater rates of Yellow Fever outbreaks.</p><h3 id="modeling-yellow-fever---simulating-kalgrafs-full-model">Modeling Yellow Fever - Simulating Kalgrafâ€™s Full Model</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/yellow-fever-full.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This is a working model of Kalgrafâ€™s diagram in its entirety. The parameters set for humans follows the nuanced modeling of the â€˜Human Populationâ€™ segment above - initialized with 100 incubating humans, and 19,900 vulnerable humans. The emerging mosquito flow in the model represents the 27,778 mosquitos Kalgraf predicted reach adulthood and can carry Yellow Fever. Out of the 500,000 mosquitos, 417,000 denote â€˜safe mosquitos.â€™ The remaining 83,000 represent â€˜new mosquitos.â€™ These numbers are estimates for easier understanding - they are not the specific numbers Kalgraf recorded in Veracruz, Mexico. Those nuanced statistics are stated below.</p><p>To better understand Kalgrafâ€™s model, a walk-through of formulas dervived through the analysis of Veracruzâ€™s Yellow Fever outbreak is provided below. The numbers in this breakdown refer to the first model introduced in the project.</p><p>-781 people are in the Incubation Stage, 803 people are in the Contagious Stage, and 450 people are sick. The peak of the Yellow Fever outbreak occurs around day 140, with nearly 450 people becoming sick. The highest volume of deaths per day is 18 people. -83,000 mosquitos are characterized as â€˜new mosquitosâ€™ and have the potential of carrying Yellow Fever if they come into contact with an infected human. These mosquitos bite 0.2 people every day - a total reaching over 16,000 per day. Kalgraf predicted 4.2% of these mosquitos will come into contact with an infected individual, making nearly 700 of these â€˜new mosquitosâ€™ carriers of Yellow Fever per day. -7,909 mosquitos are set to the incubation stage; 1,945 are in the infectious stage. Theese 1,945 infectious mosquitos are the catalyst for the peak in Yellow Fever outbreak on day 140. -8,103 humans are categorized as â€˜vulernableâ€™ for the outbreak. To calculate the number of people contracting Yellow Fever, the following formula was used: # of Contagious Mosquitoes * Bites/Day * Percent of Vulnerable Human Population -&gt; 1,945 * 0.2 * 42.6 = 166 persons per day.</p><p>The graphs below offer visual aide to Kalgrafâ€™s model through the lens of 3 scenarios: Cumulative Deaths (humans) vs Vulnerable Population, Cumulative Death during the outbreak, and Infectious Mosquitoes vs Cumulative Deaths. They serve as visual representations for the statistics recorded above.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/cumulative-vulnerable.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>The model above showcases a simulation for cumulative deaths and vulnerable people during the Yellow Fever outbreak.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/deaths.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>The model above illustrates simulated values for the number of casualities experienced during the Yellow Fever outbreak. The peak number of deaths experienced per day is 18 people, and occurs around day 140 of the 280-day outbreak.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/mosquitoes-vs-death.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>The model above represents the number of mosquitos carrying Yellow Fever and the number of deaths at the peak of the outbreak. At the peak of the outbreak, 1,945 mosquitos are infected.</p><h3 id="sensitivity-analysis---alterations-in-bites-per-day">Sensitivity Analysis - Alterations in Bites Per Day</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/sens-analysis-sick-people.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Sensitivity Analysis graphing allows the viewer to inspect the impact of various bites per day per mosquito. The values used oscillate between 10% - 50%. The graph produced illustrates the change in number of sick people, as the number of mosquito bites occuring per day changes. The relationship between bites per day and number of infected people mirror one another. When the initial value of bites per day increases, the amount of sick people increases.</p><h3 id="reducing-the-mosquito-population---implementing-a-larvacide-program">Reducing the Mosquito Population - Implementing a Larvacide Program</h3><p>The application of a Larvacide Program assumes a reduction in the number of emerging mosquitos. It does not reduce the number of pre-existing adult mosquitos.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/larvacide.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>The Larvacide Program is represented as a Converter in the diagram above. It is directly associated with the â€˜Emerging Mosquitosâ€™ flow. 27,778 represents the â€˜Emerging Mosquitosâ€™ population Kalgraf discovered in Veracruz. To visualize the implications of a possible Larvacide Program on this population, the equation for the original flow needs to be changed. The equation for this flow now represents: 27,778 - (27,778 * [Larvacide Program]). The flow equation was then altered to 27,778 â€“ (27,778 * [Mosquito Control Program]). Pause intervals and sliders were set for 10 days and 20 days, allowing a buffer for the days without a mosquito control program to be imagined.</p><p>The graphs below illustrate the importance of timing when implementing the Larvacide Program. The success of the Larvacide Program was defined as limiting the number of people impacted by Yellow Fever as 500 or less. The first graph represents a 10-day hiatus on the population, and second graph represents a 20-day hiatus. Both simulations alter the effectiveness of the Larvacide Program on the same scale: 70%, 80%, and 90%. Itâ€™s implied that a 100% effective Larvacide Program would eliminate all â€˜Emerging Mosquitos.â€™</p><h4 id="a-proposed-mosquito-control-program-10-day-simulations-vs-20-day-simulations">A Proposed Mosquito Control Program: 10-Day Simulations vs. 20-Day Simulations</h4><p><img src="/assets/images/10-Day-Sim-Mosquito-Program.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Regardless of the intensity of effectiveness set for the Larvacide Program, the ranges 70% - 90% passed the 500 people or less becoming infected by Yellow Fever success rate of the Program. As one would imply, the higher the magnitude of effectivess, the less people there were becoming sick. 10 days served as effective parameter to set for the enactment of the Larvacide Program, giving realistic measurements for its hypothetical implementation.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/20-Day-Sim-Mosquito-Program.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>The 20-day graph above tells the viewer how vital the intial start time of the Larvacide Program is. Although the intensity of effectiveness for the three scenarios remained the same - 70%, 80%, and 90% - the 20-day hiatus caused a failure in one of the scenarios. If 20 days pass, and a 70% effective Larvacide Program were applied to the â€˜Emerging Mosquitos,â€™ 550 people would become sick. This does not meet the standards required for the Programâ€™s success. Both an 80% and 90% effective Larvacide Program keep the sick population under 500 people.</p><h3 id="a-proposed-isolation-program-the-importance-of-cooperation-in-a-10-day-simulation">A Proposed Isolation Program: The Importance of Cooperation in a 10-Day Simulation</h3><p>This hypothetical Isolation Program assumes two possibilities: itâ€™s possible to detect Yellow Fever during the 4.5 day Incubation Period, and itâ€™s possible to isolate all infected individuals before they become contagious. The success of this Isolation Program follows the same criteria as the Larvacide Program: The number of people impacted by Yellow Fever must be 500 or less. The effectiveness of the Isolation Program will range from 40% - 60% (parameters I thought seemed realistic, considering the mixed cooperation among people ordered to stay inside during an epidemic).</p><p><img src="/assets/images/isolation.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Kalgrafâ€™s original model has been modified to include this hypothetical Isolation Program. A newly created â€˜Isolatonâ€™ flow links the pre-existing â€˜Incubating Peopleâ€™ Stock to a newly created â€˜Isolated Peopleâ€™ Stock. The â€˜Percentage Isolatedâ€™ Converter allows for the modification of effectiveness among the three Isolation Program scenarios.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/10-Day-Isolation.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Regardless the magnitude of the Isolation Program effectiveness, all scenarios successfully limited the number of impacted people under 500. A 60% effectiveness of the Isolation Program had a peak number of sick people at 300. A decline in 10% cooperation at the 50% simulation allowed for 100 more people to be impacted by Yellow Fever. The highest margin of people impacted by the disease was when less than 50% of the populated cooperated with the Isolation Program.</p><h3 id="epidemic-control-programs---larvacide-vs-isolation">Epidemic Control Programs - Larvacide vs Isolation</h3><p>The Isolation Program offered a safer solution to reducing the number of the people impacted by Yellow Fever, but it relied on the contigency that people would adhere to the mandated stay-at-home order. For the Larvacide Program to be successful, the insecticide needed to be extremely potent - and high rates of the chemical could potentially harm the human population. The safest protocol would be the Isolation Program, which exemplified a quicker recovery rate (80 days) than any of the simulations for the Larvacide Program.</p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">More Projects</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2013/08/24/Feebate-Program/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/feebate-model.png" alt="Conceptualizing the Shift from Conventional Vehicles to Electic Vehicles: Modeling a Proposed 'Feebate Program'"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Conceptualizing the Shift from Conventional Vehicles to Electic Vehicles: Modeling a Proposed 'Feebate Program'</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2013/08/23/Yellow-Fever/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/yellow-fever-full.png" alt="Simulating an Epidemic: Yellow Fever Modeling in Veracruz, Mexico"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Simulating an Epidemic: Yellow Fever Modeling in Veracruz, Mexico</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2013/08/22/mono-lake/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/mono-lake-1.png" alt="Modeling the Oasis of the Dry Great Basin: Predicting Water Values of Mono Lake"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Modeling the Oasis of the Dry Great Basin: Predicting Water Values of Mono Lake</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><div class="footer__container"> Â© MappingWithMatt</div></div></footer><section class="contact popup"><div class="popup__close"><div class="popup__exit"></div></div><div class="contact__container popup__container"><div class="contact__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url();"></figure></div><div class="contact__content"><div class="contact__mast section-padding--half"><div class="grid"><h2>Contact</h2></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><hr class="sep"/></div><div class="contact__form section-padding--half"><div class="grid-xlarge"> <form id="form" class="form" action="https://formcarry.com/s/HkIo0nMb7" method="POST"><div class="form__subcontainer"><div> <label for="form-first-name">First Name</label> <input type="text" name="first-name" id="form-first-name" required></div><div> <label for="form-last-name">Last Name</label> <input type="text" name="last-name" id="form-last-name" required></div></div><div> <label for="form-email">E-Mail</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="form-email" required></div><div> <label for="form-message">Message</label> <textarea name="message" id="form-message" rows="3"></textarea></div><div class="form__submit"><div class="form__btn"> <input type="submit" value="Send"></div></div><p class="form__message"></p></form></div></div></div></div></section><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
