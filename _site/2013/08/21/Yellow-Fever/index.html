In fact, many epidemiologists predict that a pandemic the scale of the Spanish influenza will soon sweep the globe (Covid-19). Yellow Fever is transmitted through mosquitoes, specifically the Aedes aegypti species. Monitoring the infected is complicated; this viral disease has different impacts on each person, making predictions on the duration and severity of Yellow Fever difficult to pinpoint.</p><p>The models below simulate the proliferation of Yellow Fever through varying scenarios and mitigation techniques. While each case offers a new lens on predicting the spread of the viral disease, they all follow a similar backstory: urban diaspora. Individuals will contract Yellow Fever and bring it back to a populated urban center. If the infected person is bitten by a mosquito not carrying the disease, that mosquito will now become contagious.</p><p>These simulations are adaptations of a Dynamo model for Yellow Fever outbreaks by Kjell Kalgraf. The figure below is the blueprint for this projectâ€™s modified simulations.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/kalgraf-model.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>Kalgrafâ€™s model is based on a real outbreak of Yellow Fever in Veracruz, Mexico (1899). The population of Veracruz was nearly 20,000 people at the time. As the viral disease swept through the urban center, many casualties were suffered - 460 people died every month at the peak of the epidemic. The model predicts the mosquito population to be roughly 500,000. Kalgraf uses this outbreak as a hypothesis of sorts; he garners data based on population sizes, lifecycle of mosquitoes, estimated bites per day, and the rates of contraction and recovery, to model the severity of Yellow Fever. Ultimately, this is shown through the comparison of cumulative number of deaths and the surviving, immune population.</p><p>The parameters set for mosquitoes are as follows. 27,778 mosquitoes emerge into adulthood per day. At the height of the epidemic, there are a total of 500,000 mosquitoes. The lifespan of a mosquito is 18 days; 4 â€˜blood feedsâ€™ are needed throughout their lifetime. Ergo, the average mosquito feeds off 0.2 persons per day - leaving roughly 100,000 bites happening per day. Itâ€™s discovered that if mosquitoes donâ€™t bite humans who are infected within their first three days, they are incapable of carrying Yellow Fever for the remainder of their lifetime. However, if mosquitoes feed off an infected person within the first 3 days (the initial period) of contracting Yellow Fever, they will carry the disease.</p><p>The parameters set for humans are a little more straightforward. A human can only contract Yellow Fever if they are bitten by a mosquito carrying the disease - it cannot be spread by another human. There are three stages to monitoring a disease: Incubation period, Contagious period, and Sick period. An infected person will enter an Incubation period (the # of days between infection and signs of symptoms) for 4.5 days. This is followed by a Contagious period of another 4.5 days, and a Sick period lasting 2.5 days. 90% of humans will recover and become immune to Yellow Fever.</p><h3 id="modeling-yellow-fever-based-on-kalgrafs-predictions---the-human-population">Modeling Yellow Fever Based on Kalgrafâ€™s Predictions - The Human Population</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/yellow-fever-human.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This model is a subset of Kalgrafâ€™s original model described prior, with emhasis on the human population. The population follows Kalgrafâ€™s study of Veracruz - out of 20,000 people, 100 are ascribed the Incubated phase leaving 19,900 vulnerable.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/vulnerable-vs-sick.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This time series model illustrates the human populationâ€™s exposure to Yellow Fever over 280 days. During the initial stages of the epidemic, there is an exponential increase in sick people as people carrying Yellow Fever are unaware in the first 4-5 days. However, as the population starts to incubate and follow proper isolation procedures, a linear decline in vulerable people appears. The amount of sick people tapers off as the amount of vulnerable people declines.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/immune-vs-deaths.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This time series model denotes Kalgrafâ€™s overarching goal - to model the number of people who survive Yellow Fever and become immune, versus the number of cumulative deaths. It parallels the 90% survival rate of the disease; 18,000 people are survive and become immune, and 2,000 people die.</p><p>Analyzing just the human population in Kalgrafâ€™s model allows for a more granular understanding of the implications associated with Yellow Fever outbreak rates and human recovery rates. For instance, the model assumes the amount of bites received by infected mosquitoes per day will remain constant over time. In reality, the amount of bites per infected mosquito will oscillate; as the human population begins building immunity, the rate of infected mosquitoes will decline - and so will the bites received per day. Moreover, holding the stages of Yellow Fever (incubated, contagious, and sick) at finite increments poses issues. For example, recovery rates will differ among person to person. While using Veracruz, Mexico as a case study allowed for predicting the diaspora of Yellow Fever in urban centers, and a better understanding of human recovery rate with real data, itâ€™s important to note the prevalence of the cityâ€™s climate for mosquito reproduction. The tropical climate with little variation from season to season is ideal for mosquitoes. Places like Veracruz with high rates of precipitation and overall higher temperatures, will experience a greater possibility of infected mosquitoes - and therefore higher rates of bites per day. Places with similar climateâ€™s to this case study will be exposed to greater rates of Yellow Fever outbreaks.</p><h3 id="modeling-yellow-fever---kalgrafs-full-model">Modeling Yellow Fever - Kalgrafâ€™s Full Model</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/yellow-fever-full.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>This is a working model of Kalgrafâ€™s diagram in its entirety. The parameters set for humans follows the nuanced modeling of the â€˜Human Populationâ€™ segment above - initialized with 100 incubating humans, and 19,900 vulnerable humans. The emerging mosquito flow in the model represents the 27,778 mosquitoes Kalgraf predicted reach adulthood and can carry Yellow Fever. Out of the 500,000 mosquitoes, 417,000 denote â€˜safe mosquitoes.â€™ The remaining 83,000 represent â€˜new mosquitoes.â€™</p><p>The graphs below offer visual aide to Kalgrafâ€™s model through the lens of 3 scenarios: Cumulative Deaths (humans) vs Vulnerable Population, Cumulative Death during the outbreak, and Infectious Mosquitoes vs Cumulative Deaths.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/cumulative-vulnerable.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>The model above showcases a simulation for cumulative deaths and vulnerable people during the Yellow Fever outbreak.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/deaths.png" alt="Map GIS" /></p><p>The model above illustrates simulated values for the number of casualities experienced during the Yellow Fever outbreak.
