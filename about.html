<p>The thought behind "Mapping with Matt" came to me when I was asked a very straightforward question: "Why do you map?" I hesitated, my mind flooding with answers all lacking of substance. "It's cool seeing how I interpret visualizations compared to my peers," I stated. What a feeble retort. Why was such a simple question so complicated to answer? I restlessly laid in bed when it hit me, my cathartic realization - mapping is complicated. To map is to think, to question, to understand.. and so much more. Mapping emulates a holistic approach of past, current, and future events: storytelling that's transcendent of time and space. Mapping underscores what it means to be human, personal yet universal. Truth-seeking, malleable, easily fabricated. These are core components of humans and maps - creations inspired by interactions, shaped by experiences, and intensified by continuous transformations. Mapping is breathing; it's effortlessly arranging your daily routine, thinking about the quickest route to work when you're running late, planning out date nights with your loved ones. If I could re-answer that question, this time I'd know: "I map because I'm human."</p>
